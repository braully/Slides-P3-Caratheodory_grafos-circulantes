abstract = {The spread of influence in a social network, diseases in a community, or failures on an interconnected site are topics studied in various fields. Convexity in graphs is a powerful framework for modeling this diffusion behavior. The Carathéodory number is an interesting convexity parameter that can be analyzed to understand the dynamics of this behavior. It is known to be NP-Complete. In this paper, we establish some bounds on the P3-Carathéodory number of graphs with diameter two. For a biconnected diameter-two graph G it holds that c(G) ≤ ∆ +1, while diameter-two with cut-vertex has c(G) = 2. In addition, we show that the P3-Caratheodory number of biconnected C6-free diameter-two graphs is at most 4.}

abstract = {Given a finite, simple, and undirected graph G=(V,E), a P3-convex set of G is a set S⊆V(G) such that every vertex of V(G)∖S has at most one neighbor in S, and the P3-convex hull of a vertex subset S′ of G is the smallest P3-convex set containing S′. The P3-hull number h(G) is the cardinality of the smallest set of vertices whose P3-convex hull is V(G). In this paper, we establish some bounds on the P3-hull number of graphs with diameter two. Particularly, for a biconnected diameter-two graph G it holds that h(G)≤⌈log(Δ(G)+1)⌉+1, while a non-biconnected diameter-two graph G has h(G)=cc(G−v), where v is a cut vertex of G and cc(G−v) is the number of connected components of G[V∖{v}]. In addition, we show that the P3-hull number of biconnected C6-free diameter-two graphs is at most 4, while for strongly regular graphs G=G(n,k,b,c) it holds that h(G)≤min{⌈k1+b⌉+1,⌈logc+1(k.c+1)⌉+1}. Finally, we consider the P3-interval number, which is the cardinality of the smallest set S of vertices such that every vertex not in S has two neighbors in this set. We show that computing the P3-interval number on diameter-two split graphs is NP - complete.}

We show that several P3∗-convexity parameters (hull number, convexity number, Carath{\'{e}}odory number, Radon number, interval number and percolation time) are NP-hard even on bipartite graphs. We prove a strong relationship between this convexity and the well known geodesic convexity, which implies several NP-hardness results for the latter. In order to show that, we prove that the hull number for the P3-convexity is NP-hard even for subgraphs of grids and that the convexity number for the P3-convexity is NP-hard even for bipartite graphs with diameter 3. We also obtain linear time algorithms to determine those parameters for the above mentioned convexities for cographs and P4-sparse graphs.},
